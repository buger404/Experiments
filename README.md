Hello，could you take a little time to read my letter? Thank you.

你好，可以花一点时间阅读我的信吗？谢谢。

**If you are not a Chinese, please translate the following text.**

我发现你经常在Github上fork其他人的vb项目，还会定期和他们同步。

我认为，如果你因为喜欢fork了他们的项目，最好不这么做。你可以star他们的项目给予他们鼓励。

另外，我建议你在Github主页可以留下你的联系方式，如果我们对你的做法有一些意见，我们也可以及时沟通。

**最后，我请求你完成一件事。**

你还记得这个项目吗：https://github.com/xxdoc/Emerald

这个项目是你当初从我这里复制的。但是，这个项目需要参与非常重要的比赛，可以麻烦你帮我删掉他吗？

删除方法很简单哦：打开上面那个网址，点击页面上的"Settings"，点击“Delete this repository”。输入“xxdoc/Emerald”，然后点击下面的按钮。然后在打开的新页面中输入你的登录密码（Github的密码），点击按钮。


English Version

I found that you often "fork" other's repository on Github, and you always keep up-to-date with their repository.

In my view, if you "forked" their repository because you liked it, I advice you not to do that. You could "star" their repository to encourage them.

Otherwise, I advice that you can leave some information on your personal page so that we can contact you.

**In the end, I sincerely hope you could help me.**

Can you remember this repository: https://github.com/xxdoc/Emerald

This repository was "forked" from mine by you. But, this repository will attend a very important competition, could you help me to delete it?

The way to delete is also easy: open the URL above, and then click the "Settings" button in the page. Click "Delete this repository", and then type "xxdoc/Emerald", click the button in the bottom. Finally, type your password in the page, click the button.

THANK YOU.
